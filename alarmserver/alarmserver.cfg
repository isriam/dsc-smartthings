## Experimental CallbackURL functionality - Mainly for Smartthings right now
## The resulting path for callbackurls looks like this
## This likely needs to be fixed to allow more flexibility for any service?
## Suggestions welcome 
## ${callbackurl_base}/${callbackurl_app_id}/panel/${code}/${zoneorpartitionnumber}?access_token=${callbackurl_access_token}

## Smartthings or generic callback URL setup
## Check to make sure that when you are logged in to https://graph.api.smartthings.com that your URL prefix is not
## something else like https://graph-na02-useast1.api.smartthings.com
callbackurl_base=https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/installations
callbackurl_app_id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
callbackurl_access_token=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
## Define the event codes you want callbacks for, the codes below
## cover zone open/close, partition ready, not ready, armed, exit delay, entry delay and in alarm status
## these should cover most use cases
